# Neko Floorplan Analyzer — Demo Package

This is a **fully mocked** demo for *Neko*, a friendly startup-style floorplan/blueprint analyzer.
It simulates an AI upload + analysis flow and displays visual overlays and extracted room data.

## Contents
- `index.html` — main demo page
- `style.css` — styles
- `script.js` — mocked analysis logic (no backend required)
- `assets/` — sample floorplan image and logo

## Deploy to GitHub Pages (3 steps)
1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g. `neko-floorplan-demo`) and push this project to it.
2. On GitHub, go to **Settings → Pages**, set branch to `main` (or `gh-pages`) and folder `/ (root)`.
3. After a minute, your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/neko-floorplan-demo/`.

## Local preview
You can preview locally with a simple HTTP server from the project root:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```
